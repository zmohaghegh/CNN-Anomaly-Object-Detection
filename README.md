# CNN-Anomaly-Object-Detection

This repository features a Deep Learning-based system designed to detect anomalies or unexpected objects in images. Unlike standard classification, this system focuses on identifying deviations from a "normal" learned pattern.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / Autoencoder.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras.
- **Objective:** Learn a compact representation of "normal" data and detect anomalies based on Reconstruction Loss or Feature Deviation.
- **Application:** Industrial quality control, medical imaging, and security surveillance.

## 🚀 Features
- Automated data preprocessing and normalization.
- CNN-based feature extraction layers.
- Visualization of anomaly heatmaps (Localization).
